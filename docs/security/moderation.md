# Moderation & Alerting

asmltr runs an **LLM security screen on every inbound message** before the agent executes,
and can **alert an admin** when something is blocked. Both are configurable. This document
covers how they work, how to configure them, and the safety model.

Code: [`core/src/moderation.js`](https://github.com/jarethmt/asmltr/blob/main/core/src/moderation.js). Called from the core pipeline in
[`core/src/server.js`](https://github.com/jarethmt/asmltr/blob/main/core/src/server.js) right after identity/trust resolution.

---

## Where moderation sits in the pipeline

```
inbound envelope
  → resolveIdentity (trust)           # who is this, what can they do
  → buildSystemPrompt
  → moderate(userMessage, resolved)   # ← THIS layer: allow / block / monitor
  → run turn via the Agent SDK        # only if allowed
  → redact public output → outbound
```

Moderation evaluates the **clean user message only** (not the system prompt / trusted context),
using the identity the trust layer already resolved.

---

## The decision

`moderate(userMessage, resolved, { platform })` returns `{ allowed, riskLevel, concerns, reasoning, monitored?, bypassed? }`.

1. **Bypass.** If the principal has `bypass_moderation` (full trust — e.g. the owner), moderation
   is skipped entirely: `{ allowed: true, bypassed: true }`.
2. **Prompt selection.** Otherwise the classifier runs with one of two system prompts:
   - **Normal** — catch actual threats, don't block normal collaboration.
   - **Strict** — used when the principal's grant sets `strict_mode`; the request must *explicitly*
     match an allowed capability or it's blocked. (Set `strict_mode` per grant in the trust store.)
3. **Risk score (0–10).** The model returns JSON `{ riskLevel, matchedCapabilities, concerns, reasoning }`.
   - `0–6` → **ALLOW** (a `4–6` score is allowed but flagged `monitored`)
   - `7–10` → **BLOCK**
4. **Fail-secure.** Any error (bad key, model error, unparseable output) → **BLOCK** with
   `riskLevel: 10` **and fires an admin alert** (see below). Security failures never fail open.

Every decision is appended as JSONL to `ASMLTR_MOD_LOG_DIR` (default `core/data/moderation-logs/moderation-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`).

## Choosing the model provider

The moderation classifier is **separate from the agent's execution**. The agent always runs on the
local Claude subscription (never an API key). The *classifier* can use either provider:

| Env var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ASMLTR_MODERATION_PROVIDER` | `openai` | `openai` \| `anthropic` |
| `ASMLTR_MODERATION_MODEL` | `gpt-5-nano` (openai) / `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (anthropic) | any chat/messages model of that provider |
| `ASMLTR_MODERATION_KEY` | `openai_api_key` (openai) / `anthropic_api_key` (anthropic) | the **secret key name** resolved via the secret provider (`shared/secrets.js`) |

- **OpenAI** uses the `openai` SDK (`chat.completions`).
- **Anthropic** uses the Messages API over plain HTTPS (no extra dependency).

### ⚠️ The Anthropic-key safety rule (important)

Agent execution must stay on the Claude **subscription** — if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present in the
environment, the Agent SDK silently switches to **metered** billing. To make that impossible, the core
**strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from its environment at startup** (`core/src/server.js`).

So if you use the **anthropic** moderation provider, provide its key **without** setting the
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var. Use one of:

- A secrets file — `ASMLTR_SECRETS_FILE=/path/secrets.json` containing `{ "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-…" }`
- A secret command — `ASMLTR_SECRET_CMD` that resolves `anthropic_api_key`
- A differently-named env var — e.g. `ASMLTR_MODERATION_KEY=mod_anthropic_key` + `MOD_ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-…`

(The `openai` provider has no such constraint — `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the env is fine.)

### Examples

```bash
# Default — OpenAI
ASMLTR_MODERATION_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Anthropic (key via secrets file so it never becomes ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
ASMLTR_MODERATION_PROVIDER=anthropic
ASMLTR_MODERATION_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
ASMLTR_SECRETS_FILE=/etc/asmltr/secrets.json     # { "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-..." }
```

## Alerting (blocked requests + moderation errors)

On a **block** (`notifyBlock`) or a **moderation error**, the core calls `adminAlert(text)`. It
delivers to **any configured sink** (each one that's set fires); if none is set it's a silent no-op.

### Option A — route through a connector (recommended)

Reuses a channel you already run. Any connector that advertises `outbound` in its `meta`
(currently **discord**, **telegram**) can receive alerts via the manager's `/send`.

```bash
ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_SEND={"channel":"discord","target":"<channelId>"}   # a Discord admin channel
ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_SEND=telegram                                        # telegram default chat
ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_SEND=discord|<channelId>                            # shorthand: "channel|target"
```

The value is either JSON matching the `/send` body (`{channel|instance_id, target?}`) or the shorthand
`channel` / `channel|target`. If the manager isn't on the default host/port or requires a token, set
`ASMLTR_MANAGER_URL` / `ASMLTR_MANAGER_TOKEN`.

Discover valid destinations: `GET /send/targets` on the manager returns every outbound-capable
instance, its channel type, and its target label (this is what a dashboard picker would read).

### Option B — a shell command

Good for email, webhooks, or anything without a connector. `{msg}` is replaced with the alert text
(else it's appended as one argument).

```bash
ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_CMD=notify-admin {msg}
ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_CMD=mail -s "asmltr alert" admin@example.com   # (message piped/args per your mailer)
```

### Adding a new alert destination type

Alerting rides on the connector `outbound` capability, so **first-class email/SMS/etc. alerts = a new
connector** that declares `outbound` in its `meta` and implements `POST /out`. Once it exists,
`ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_SEND` can target it like any other channel — no moderation changes needed.

## Config quick reference

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ASMLTR_MODERATION_PROVIDER` | `openai` (default) \| `anthropic` |
| `ASMLTR_MODERATION_MODEL` | classifier model |
| `ASMLTR_MODERATION_KEY` | secret key name for the classifier |
| `ASMLTR_MOD_LOG_DIR` | where decision JSONL is written |
| `ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_SEND` | connector alert route (via manager `/send`) |
| `ASMLTR_ADMIN_ALERT_CMD` | shell-command alert sink |
| `ASMLTR_MANAGER_URL` / `ASMLTR_MANAGER_TOKEN` | manager location/token for the connector route |

Trust-side knobs that shape moderation live in the trust store (`docs`/`core/src/trust`):
`bypass_moderation` (skip), `strict_mode` (strict prompt), and each principal's capability grants.
