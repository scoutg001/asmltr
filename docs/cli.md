# The `asmltr` CLI

`asmltr` is the host-local terminal client for the assistant backend. It observes
every agent session the collector records, coordinates messages **out** through any
connector, takes over a running channel session, and launches monitored interactive
sessions — all from one binary.

Run with no arguments to open the [live TUI dashboard](#the-tui); otherwise it's a
set of one-shot subcommands.

```
asmltr                 live TUI dashboard
asmltr ls              list active sessions
asmltr map             active sessions grouped by working dir (collision radar)
asmltr who <path>      which sessions recently touched a file/dir
asmltr brief           compact summary
asmltr events [..]     recent events  (--surface --identity --session --limit)
asmltr tail            live global event stream
asmltr watch <key>     live stream for one session
asmltr system          current system metrics
asmltr send <ch> <target> "<text>"   deliver a message OUT through any connector
asmltr announce "<text>" [--to T]    post a cross-session announcement
asmltr announcements                 list live announcements
asmltr attach <key>    claim a channel session + resume it in tmux
asmltr release <key>   end a takeover; channel resumes
asmltr kill <id>       SIGTERM an ephemeral session's pid
asmltr stop <id>       SIGINT an ephemeral session
asmltr diff <id>       git diff of a session's worktree
asmltr claude [args]   launch a monitored session on the Claude engine
asmltr gemini [args]   … on the Gemini engine
asmltr codex  [args]   … on the Codex engine
```

!!! tip "Reasoning engines"
    `asmltr claude|gemini|codex` each launch a wrapped, monitored, takeover-able session on that
    [reasoning engine](REASONING-ENGINES.md) (whichever CLI harnesses are installed). The `<agent-name>`
    command points at the **default** engine, chosen in Settings → Engines. `asmltr silo`, `asmltr backup`,
    and `asmltr vault` round out the toolbelt.

!!! note "Where it points"
    Every command talks to one of three host-local services. Defaults assume the
    standard host layout; override with env vars (see [Environment](#environment)).

    | Service | Default | Used by |
    |---|---|---|
    | collector | `http://127.0.0.1:3017` | reads (`ls`, `brief`, `events`, `tail`, `watch`, `system`, `map`, `who`) + control (`kill`, `stop`, `diff`) |
    | core | `http://127.0.0.1:3023` | takeover (`attach`, `release`) + `announce` / `announcements` |
    | connector manager | `http://127.0.0.1:3024` | `send` (outbound to any channel) |

## Observe

Read-only views over the collector's live session and event stream.

### `asmltr` (TUI) & `asmltr ls`

`asmltr` with no arguments opens the [TUI dashboard](#the-tui). For a quick
non-interactive snapshot, `asmltr ls` lists every active session.

```bash
asmltr ls
```

Prints a table — surface, kind, age, idle time, total tokens, multiplexer, and the
task/session key — one colour-coded row per active session, with a total at the foot.

### `asmltr brief`

```bash
asmltr brief
```

Renders the compact summary (the same JSON that backs the morning brief): active
session count, tokens burned in the last 24h broken down by surface, and a short
list of the currently-active sessions. Returns the `/api/brief` payload rendered for
the terminal.

### `asmltr events`

Recent events, newest last, with optional filters.

```bash
asmltr events --surface discord --identity someuser --limit 40
asmltr events --session discord:guild:123
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--surface <s>` | only events from one connector (`discord`, `telegram`, `github`, `mcp`, …) |
| `--identity <i>` | only events for one resolved identity |
| `--session <key>` | only events for one session key |
| `--limit <n>` | how many events (default `40`) |

Each line shows the timestamp, surface, event type, identity, a detail snippet, and
token counts when present.

### `asmltr tail` & `asmltr watch <key>`

Live event streams over the collector's socket.

```bash
asmltr tail                       # every event, every session
asmltr watch discord:guild:123    # one session only
```

`tail` prints the global event stream as it happens; `watch` filters to a single
`session_id`. Both run until `Ctrl-C`.

!!! tip
    `watch` needs `socket.io-client`. If it isn't installed, run
    `npm install` in the CLI directory as the error message instructs.

### `asmltr system`

```bash
asmltr system
```

The most recent host sample: CPU %, load 1/5, memory used/total, and disk
used %/free GB.

### `asmltr map` — collision radar

```bash
asmltr map
```

Shows **where sessions are actually working**, grouped by git repo. The collector
derives location from **real tool activity** — it reads file paths out of recent tool
events (last 30 min) and resolves each to its enclosing **git repo root** — *not* the
directory a session was spawned in. A session only appears once it touches files.

Repos with more than one active session are flagged
`⚠ N sessions — possible collision`, making it a fast way to catch two agents about
to step on each other in the same tree. Under each repo, sessions list their surface,
title, age, and the specific sub-directories they've hit.

### `asmltr who <path>`

```bash
asmltr who /root/projects/personal/asmltr/core
```

The inverse of `map`: given a file or directory, list every session that has
**touched that path** recently. The collector scans tool events (last 6h) whose
payload references the path, grouping by session with a hit count, age, and a sample
of what the session did there. Useful before editing a shared file — check nobody
else is in it.

### `asmltr announcements`

```bash
asmltr announcements
```

Lists live cross-session announcements (see [`announce`](#asmltr-announce) below)
with their id, timestamp, target, urgency, and expiry.

---

## Coordinate

Push messages **outward** through the running connectors, or broadcast context to
other sessions.

### `asmltr send`

Deliver a message out through **any** connector — cross-channel, from the terminal.

```bash
# text
asmltr send discord 123 "shipping now"

# a file attachment (image / PDF / anything the channel supports)
asmltr send discord 123 --file /root/report.pdf --caption "the report"
```

Usage:

```
asmltr send <channel> <target> "<text>"
asmltr send <channel> <target> --file <path> [--caption "<text>"]
```

- `<channel>` — connector name (`discord`, `telegram`, …).
- `<target>` — channel-specific destination id.
- Text mode posts the message; `--file` mode uploads a file, with an optional
  `--caption` (falls back to any trailing text).

Posts to the connector manager's `/send`; prints `✓ sent …` with the delivery route
on success, or the error on failure.

### `asmltr announce`

Post a **cross-session announcement** — a note delivered into *other* sessions'
context on their next turn.

```bash
asmltr announce "deploying to prod in 5 — hold merges" --to surface:discord
asmltr announce "incident: API down" --urgent --ttl 3600
```

Usage:

```
asmltr announce "<text>" [--to <target>] [--urgent] [--ttl <seconds>]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--to <target>` | who sees it — `*` (all, default), a session id, `surface:discord`, or `identity:someuser` |
| `--urgent` | mark it urgent |
| `--ttl <sec>` | expire after N seconds |

Returns the announcement id, resolved target, and creation time. List live ones with
[`asmltr announcements`](#asmltr-announcements).

---

## Control / takeover

Reach into a running session — claim it, stop it, or inspect its changes.

### `asmltr attach <key>` / `asmltr release <key>`

Claim a live **channel** session and resume it interactively in **tmux**, so you can
drive it hands-on and detach without ending it.

```bash
asmltr attach discord:guild:123
# … work in the resumed claude session …
# detach with the tmux prefix + d; the channel stays paused
asmltr release discord:guild:123
```

`attach`:

1. Claims the conversation via the core (`/v2/claim`) — the channel is **paused** so
   the connector stops answering while you're in control.
2. Resumes the session's engine id in a fresh tmux session (`claude --resume …`) in
   the session's own working directory, then attaches your terminal to it.
3. On detach the session stays alive (re-attach with `asmltr attach` again). When
   `claude` exits, the channel is automatically **released**.

`release` kills the tmux session (if any) and releases the claim so the channel
resumes normally. With no TTY, `attach` creates the session and tells you to
`tmux attach -t <name>` manually.

!!! note "Takeover mechanics"
    This is the CLI face of session steering/injection. For the full model — how the
    reply routes back to the origin channel vs. types into the tmux pane — see
    [Session steering & injection](coordination/injection.md).

### `asmltr kill <id>` / `asmltr stop <id>`

Signal an ephemeral session's process directly (privileged — needs the control
token).

```bash
asmltr stop discord:guild:123          # SIGINT the process
asmltr kill discord:guild:123          # SIGTERM the pid
asmltr kill discord:guild:123 --hard   # SIGKILL after a grace period
```

- `stop` sends `SIGINT` (interrupt the current turn).
- `kill` sends `SIGTERM`; `--hard` escalates to `SIGKILL` after a grace period.

Both print the affected pid on success.

### `asmltr diff <id>`

```bash
asmltr diff discord:guild:123
```

Prints the `git diff` of a session's worktree — what the session has changed on disk
so far — or `(no changes)`.

---

## Sessions

### `asmltr claude [args]`

Launch an **interactive** Claude Code session that's wrapped for monitoring and
takeover. Everything after `claude` is passed straight through to the underlying
launcher.

```bash
asmltr claude
asmltr claude --resume
```

The session runs as a real interactive `claude` TUI (in tmux), while its events flow
to the collector like any other session — so it shows up in `ls`, `map`, `who`, the
TUI, and the dashboard, and can be steered/taken over. See the
[CLI-sessions connector](https://github.com/jarethmt/asmltr/blob/main/connectors/cli.md) for how these sessions are wired in.

---

## Environment

`asmltr` reads its endpoints and tokens from the environment. Defaults suit the
standard single-host layout.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ASMLTR_COLLECTOR_BASE` | `http://127.0.0.1:3017` | collector base URL (reads + control) |
| `ASMLTR_CORE_BASE` | `http://127.0.0.1:3023` | core base URL (`attach`/`release`, `announce`) |
| `ASMLTR_MANAGER_BASE` | `http://127.0.0.1:3024` | connector manager base URL (`send`) |
| `ASMLTR_INSIGHTS_TOKEN` | — | bearer for collector reads + socket auth |
| `ASMLTR_INSIGHTS_CONTROL_TOKEN` | — | bearer for privileged control (`kill`, `stop`, `diff`) |
| `ASMLTR_MANAGER_TOKEN` | — | bearer for the manager's `/send` |

!!! warning "Dev mode"
    With no `ASMLTR_INSIGHTS_TOKEN` set, the collector runs auth-disabled (dev
    mode) and the CLI's help footer shows `(no token — dev mode)`. In production
    the collector sits behind a reverse proxy and these tokens are required.

    If a command fails with a connection error, check the collector is running at
    the address shown in the footer.

---

## The TUI

Run `asmltr` with no arguments for the full-screen cockpit — an active-sessions
table, a live CPU chart, and a global event log, all updating in real time over the
collector's socket.

**Dashboard keys** (session table focused):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` | select a session |
| `Enter` | open the **watch** view for the selected session |
| `k` / `x` | kill the selected session (with a confirm dialog) |
| `s` | open **connector settings** |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C` / `Esc` | quit |

### Watch view

`Enter` on a session opens a full-screen live stream of just that session — seeded
with recent history, then live-appended. Long tool output is preserved in full;
scroll with `↑↓`/`PgUp`/`PgDn`.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `i` | **steer** — open a text box; the message is injected into the session and the reply routes back to its origin channel (or is typed into the tmux pane for CLI sessions) |
| `k` | **stop** the in-flight turn (the session survives and stays resumable) |
| `Esc` | back to the dashboard |

See [Session steering & injection](coordination/injection.md) for what `i` and `k`
do under the hood.

### Connector settings (`s`)

`s` opens a drill-down settings overlay with three levels:

1. **Instances** — every connector instance (● enabled / ○ disabled), by name and
   type.
2. **Instance** — one connector's interactive **panels** plus its config fields.
   Toggle booleans with `SPACE`, edit scalars with `ENTER`. A config change is
   validated against the connector's schema and **restarts** that connector.
3. **Panel** — a connector-declared panel. The built-in **Channels** panel is a
   live per-channel enable/disable list: `SPACE`/`ENTER` toggles a channel, `d`
   flips the default (listen-everywhere vs. allowlist), `r` reloads. Toggles take
   effect immediately — no restart.

`Esc` steps back a level (and closes at the top); `r` reloads the current level.
